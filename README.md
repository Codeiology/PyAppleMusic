# PyAppleMusic

Possibly the literal most useless program ever.

# What does it do

It can search, play, and pause music from your library, except in the terminal!

# Setup / Requirements

You gotta have a Mac with Apple Music installed, btw. (It should be installed by default unless you managed to somehow delete it)

`git clone https://github.com/Codeiology/PyAppleMusic.git`
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 music.py`
